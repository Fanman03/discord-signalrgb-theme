# discord-signalrgb-theme
A BetterDiscord theme designed to match the UI of [SignalRGB](https://signalrgb.com). Core theming based on [AMOLED-Cord](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord).

The fine people in charge of BetterDiscord's offical theme repo won't allow this because its a "minor edit of an existing theme" but that's neither here nor there...

To install this theme, download [this file](https://github.com/Fanman03/discord-signalrgb-theme/releases/download/v1.1.0/SignalRGB.theme.css) and copy it to `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes`
